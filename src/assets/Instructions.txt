This tool is designed to streamline the deck building process at your LGS.
To get a sorted list of sets your cards have been printed in, simply copy and paste your decklist into this form in one of the formats below.

If the set binder you are looking in doesn't have a card you are looking for, or you don't want that particular printing, use the yellow "Remove Printing" button to remove only that instance of the card.
When you find a card, or want to remove it from the decklist entirely, use the green "Card Found" button to clear all instances of that card.

If you edit the decklist, all of the data will be fetched again, so any printings or cards you have removed will reappear.

**Note: Basic lands are automatically removed from the search
**Note: Commander Sets have been grouped together
**Note: Only paper, non-promo printings are shown
